# Dicecloud V2 Unofficial User Guide

This is an unofficial guide for users and library developers working with [Dicecloud V2](https://beta.dicecloud.com). This guide is written by a user, for users, and is not officially sponsored or maintained by Thaum, the developer of Dicecloud.

### Getting Started

To be able to access Dicecloud V2, you will need one of two things:

* A Patreon account backing [Dicecloud on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dicecloud) at the Adventurer tier \($5/month\) or higher.
* An invite from a Patron of the Hero \($10/month\) tier or above.

If you are using your own Patreon backing, the first thing you'll need to do is create an account. You can sign in with Google, Patreon, or create a new Dicecloud account; I recommend creating your account through Patreon, but you can link your Patreon successfully to any of the above by accessing the Account menu with the gear icon in the top left.

If you are using an invite provided by a Patron, the person inviting you will need to send you an invite link. From there, you can either create your account or sign into an existing one to access the site.

### Further Help

This guide is a work in progress, and could never hope to cover everything V2 is capable of. If you find yourself needing any additional help, you can reach out to the community through the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qEvdfeB).
