# Character Creation 101

Dicecloud is an immensely powerful and flexible character management app, and as such its learning curve is quite steep. However, if you just want to create a simple character and get playing as fast as possible, this guide is for you.

This section of the guide assumes that you are playing Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition, 5e for short. The same basic principles apply for other systems, but the examples given will be as such.

### Bases/Cores

The first step of creating a character is selecting a base or core. While these terms are community-created, the basic trend is as follows:

* Bases provide a simple starting point for other libraries and users to build from around a certain system \(D&D 5e, Star Wars 5e, Pathfinder 2e, etc.\). You'll usually need to pair these with other libraries to fill them out with content, or create your own.
* Cores provide a more all-inclusive package, and attempt to provide as much content from a specific system as possible.

The first thing you'll need to do when creating a new character is choose your base/core. While it's quite possible to create your own, this is a lot of unnecessary work, and avoiding this type of work is the purpose of libraries.

These are currently the most prominent bases and cores for 5e:

* [LinkTheBalrog's Base](https://beta.dicecloud.com/library/NMgBJwmFKjkxvM8HW) by LinkTheBalrog
* [Kat's Core](https://beta.dicecloud.com/library/dGb2n9TEheo3PnAZa) by KatrinaKitten

Once you've subscribed to the library for the base or core of your choice, you can import it by going to the Tree tab, clicking the + button at the bottom right, and selecting "Property from library". Each individual base or core will usually include a README with more specific instructions.

### The Slot System

After importing your base or core of choice, the next step is to head to the Character tab. You should see a card with a black border which says "Build" on top. This is the slot interface, and is the primary way of making decisions about your character in V2.

A slot is, in essence, a hole in your character sheet, which can be filled with various options. Assuming your base/core of choice is set up well, you should be able to do most of your character creation process just by hitting the + button below a given slot's label, selecting an option from the menu that pops up, and clicking "Insert" at the bottom right.

Slots are primarily a library creation utility. The options they pull in aren't actually in your sheet until you click "Insert"; rather, they're in whatever libraries you've subscribed to. You should almost never need to create a slot manually.
{% endhint %}

Once you've made your selections to create your character, you can switch to the Stats, Features, Inventory, and Spells tabs to see the result.

### The Stats Tab

The tab you'll probably spend the most time on is the Stats tab. This is where your core stats like ability scores, proficiencies, spell slots, and so on live. It's also where you can see and use your available actions, manage your hit points, and perform rests. Feel free to play around with all the little levers and knobs on the Stats tab to get familiar with how they work!

#### Actions

Actions are Dicecloud's primary automation tool, and once your character is set up, you'll likely find a number of them hanging out on your Stats tab. They look something like this:

Clicking the circular button at the top left of the action card will perform the action; a use \(top left\) will be consumed, along with the number shown of each attribute or ammunition item above the description. Additionally, rolls will be performed and attributes modified as shown below the description.

Actions can also sometimes apply buffs, which are persistent modifiers to your character representing a status condition or temporary ability. While these don't show on the action card itself, they will appear in a list on the left-hand side of the Stats tab when applied, and can be removed with the trash can icon.
