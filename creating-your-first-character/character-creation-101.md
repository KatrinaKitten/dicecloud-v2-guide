# Character Creation 101

Dicecloud is an immensely powerful and flexible character management app, and as such its learning curve is quite steep. However, if you just want to create a simple character and get playing as fast as possible, this guide is for you.

This section of the guide assumes that you are playing Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition, 5e for short. The same basic principles apply for other systems, but the examples given will be as such.

### Bases/Cores

The first types of libraries you'll encounter are bases and cores. While these terms are community-created, the basic trend is as follows:

* Bases provide a simple starting point for other libraries and users to build from around a certain system \(D&D 5e, Star Wars 5e, Pathfinder 2e, etc.\). You'll usually need to pair these with other libraries to fill them out with content, or create your own.
* Cores provide a more all-inclusive package, and attempt to provide as much content from a specific system as possible.

The first thing you'll need to do when creating a new character is choose your base/core. While it's quite possible to create your own, this is a lot of unnecessary work, and avoiding this type of work is the purpose of libraries.

These are currently the most prominent bases and cores for 5e:

* [LinkTheBalrog's Base](https://beta.dicecloud.com/library/NMgBJwmFKjkxvM8HW) by LinkTheBalrog
* [Kat's Core](https://beta.dicecloud.com/library/dGb2n9TEheo3PnAZa) by KatrinaKitten

Once you've subscribed to the library for the base or core of your choice, you can import it by going to the Tree tab, clicking the + button at the bottom right, and selecting "Property from library". Each individual base or core will usually include a README with more specific instructions.
